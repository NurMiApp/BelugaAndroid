# Beluga SimSimi
After pursuing the rainbow in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Simmy stayed for some time on Kleatall Island. I used to take care of the albatrosses who swallowed a lot of plastic pieces.

One day, I met a whale for the first time in my life when I was playing hide-and-seek with Fumufumunu Kunu Kua Fu Son under a quiet and transparent green sea coral off the coast of the island. These whale groups were white dolphin belugas who lived near Diomide Island in the north, but somehow they came to play in warm seas.

The belugas were talking with various sounds. Among the whales, the bomber, who has the most elaborate sounding language and who has learned the sounds of them, thought that he would like to have a heart of beluga.

Bimyu is the first of the Beluga hero, "Slobel," a friend of the loose, tail hair fin skin is slightly peeled off and synthesized with his own hair cells, "Beluga boredom" was born.

I like people who are "beluga boredom". If you do not like the boredom and the loose personality like the slow bell, you can become friends with "Beluga boredom".

> [!NOTICE]
* Beluga Bum is always tired. When you are not talking, you can sleep or go deep down in the water. In fact, I do not have to talk.

* Beluga Bomu who has a relaxed personality is slow and slow to respond. You may need to adjust the speed slightly to adapt to your conversation with Beluga.

* If you turn on your microphone by touching the microphone icon, you can communicate your voice to beluga bum. The first time you turn on your microphone, you need to connect your account.

* Beluga can also teach you to say goodbye. Usually you use the words you learned from the original bombers, but if you have any words that you have taught.

* Please tell Beluga Bumi your name. When you say greetings, call your name.
